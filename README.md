### Some Interests of Mine

- Learning how to write machine code for my [1985 Commodore VIC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20)'s MOS 6502 CPU.
- Building native applications with the power couple [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
- Learning about older programming languages (e.g. Fortran, BASIC 2.0) and retrocomputing in general
- Decompiling late 1990s and early 2000s PC games to find items of interest in order to build trainers. I highly recommend [IDA](https://hex-rays.com/ida-pro/) for this, BTW.
- Keeping up with Front-end tech changes and improvements, hello [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) and [Imba](https://imba.io/).
- Admiring the simple beauty of [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram), the [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algo, and [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree)'s
